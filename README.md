# gpx-viz
A personal project to visualize my own skiing on Mt. Hood over the last 7 years. Visualization shows all tracks compressed as if they took place on one single day. The different colors represent whether the skiing was lift served or self powered backcountry skiing. Static versions and versions without a map background are available in the output directory.
